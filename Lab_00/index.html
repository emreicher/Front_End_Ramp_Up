	<h1> My Story </h1>
	<p>Taking one day at a time. Enjoying life, while still in denial that I'm in the 'real-world'. Loving my career &enjoying time with my roommates, friends and family. I am entirely too self-incriminating (at times) and I usually tell people more than I should, and probably more than they care to know. I'm working on it. </p>
